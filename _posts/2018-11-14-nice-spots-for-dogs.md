### Parc de la Colline du Chateau

Castle Hill (as it's known in English) has a large open space at the very top of the hill and endless pathways and stairs that circle the mountain. It boasts with trees, bush and green space and small squares in between the staircase levels that create little pockets in almost in the woods to let your dog play safely away from cars and crowds of people. Officially dogs are allowed on leash only. If you arrive early in the morning right after the gates open and before the crowds of people arrive, the space is empty except for the occasional jogger and other dog walkers.

### Promenade des Anglais

This is a wide boardwalk for pedestrians between the main road and the beach. It’s a wonderful walk starting starting from the bottom of Castle Hill going towards the airport and back — great spot for a night walk, very safe, lots of lights and people. There’s over 5km from the airport to around the coast point to finish at the pier. Depending on where you start, the closer you are to the point and Castle Hill, the more people and night life you’ll see.

### Parc Castel des Deux Rois
This park has an offical enclosed area for off-leash dogs. Unfortunately it's not very big and hangs off the side of the hill in a wooded section. If you enter the park from the West-South end (the side closest to the Port of Nice), you'll walk right beside it. Look to your right as you come up the hill through the more wooded section of the park. Luckily, if you keep going past the dog park and climb to the very top, you'll be greeting by an extremly wide open field with a view of the city. One end of the park has a children's section (there's a drinking fountain in this section as well) but the space is more than big enough to keep your pup clear of the play structures. I was lucky enough to find this space in the afternoon during a weekday so it was completely empty and made an excellent space to throw a ball around and let Meeka run wild.

### Beaches
Dogs are not allowed on the beach anywhere near the old town on central part of Nice. There’s a dog beach at the far end of the strip, near the airport and another one on the other end of Villefranche-sur-mer — both quite far to walk but if easy to get to if you have a car. Otherwise, you’ll have to avoid the beaches during the main seasons, by October we noticed dogs on the beach at night but be mindful that people still lie down there during the day. Pick up after your dog. Note that there are rats that hang along the edges of the beach where there’s rocks just below the wall at night — if your dog has good hunting instincts just be aware.
